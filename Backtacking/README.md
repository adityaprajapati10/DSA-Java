This File contains Java code for various  Backtacking Operations, including Tiling Problem, Rat in maze, N Queens, Solving a Sudoko and Print Permutations . Additionally, there are solutions for 5 practice questions.

## Contents

1. Tiling Problem - Java code to count the number of ways to tile the given board. Given a board of size " 2 by n" and tile of size " 2 by 1".

3. Rat in maze - Calculate rat's maze traversal ways in an 'n x n' matrix with blocked paths represented as '-1' and open paths as '0', considering only rightward and downward movements.
